# Machine Learning Reinforce learning.

Reinforced learning is a branch of machine learning. it is also known as Online Learning.
Among many distribution, what is the best to explore. Example an advertising campaingn for Coca, there are 5 images, what is the best for the campaingn
How to maximize your return, for example there are 5 slot machine, what is the best for you to play?
Peolple use if for AB testing website mainly when we are using multiple layouts for thousands of user.

# UCB and Thompson sampling 
Thompson sampling was originally described in an article from 1933 and nowadays is widely used in many online learning problem and also A/B testing in website.
They are used to solve bandit problem.

UCB is a deterministic, require update for every round.
Thompson is probabilistic (we set distribuition that represent our perception about the world), can accomodate delayed feedback.
